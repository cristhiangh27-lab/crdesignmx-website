# Zicatela Surf Retreat · Oaxaca, Mexico · Hospitality · 2019

Complex of tropical cabins facing the sea, conceived as a beach retreat with a relaxed atmosphere and a strong indoor-outdoor connection. The project organizes single-level volumes with terraces and shaded porches, integrating pedestrian circulation over sand and coastal vegetation to frame views and routes towards the landscape.

## Concept
The proposal seeks a balance between constructive simplicity and sensory beach experience, prioritizing:
- Outdoor living: terraces, porches and open living areas
- Shade and thermal comfort through covers, ruffles and filter elements
- Constant visual relationship with the environment (sea / vegetation) through large openings
- Light implementation on the ground with clear routes and meeting areas

## Design strategies
- Modular volumetry: units aligned and connected by porticos to organize the whole
- Warm materiality: apparent wood, neutral finishes and covers in earth tones to harmonize with the site
- Controlled transparency: large windows for natural lighting and a feeling of spaciousness
- Coastal landscaping: low vegetation as a filter, edge and transition between sand and architecture
- Common spaces: palapa / open pavilion as a social and shade point

## Key elements
- Architectural conceptual design
- Implementation and organization of the complex
- Definition of materiality and finishes (wood, sand tones, covers)
- 3D modeling and representation for presentation
- Setting and proposal for outdoor furniture (terraces / palapa)

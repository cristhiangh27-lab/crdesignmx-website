# Penthouse Jaime Torres Bodet - CDMX - Residential - 2024

This Penthouse located in Santa María la Ribera is a residential project located at Jaime Torres Bodet 182. Designed as a creative refuge in the heights, the space responds to a hybrid life between home and workshop: a flexible, intimate and bright place for a sculptor who works from home and needs both concentration and inspiration, without losing the possibility of receiving visitors and temporarily hosting his partner or sister.

## Architectural concept
The proposal is born from the dialogue between art, intimacy and the city. An architecture of simple lines and clear volumes is proposed, where natural light becomes the main material to accompany artistic production and daily life. The roof, inspired by the curvature of tree leaves, defines a soft silhouette that is integrated into the urban sky and works as a poetic gesture towards nature, in direct relation to the views towards the Alameda.

## Architectural program
- Access and transition (controlled arrival to the attic)
- Social area to receive 3 or 4 people comfortably
- Compact but functional kitchen (emphasis on order and efficiency)
- Workspace/artistic production at home
- Main sleeping area for couples, maintaining privacy
- Occasional rest space for sister or partner (without compromising order)
- Terrace/outdoor area for contemplation and views

## Additional notes
This project was conceived to become tangible from the start: it was modelled, cut and assembled as part of the design process, ensuring spatial clarity, honest proportions and sober materiality. PH Santa María synthesizes an accessible and sensitive way of living in the city: a home that understands that home can also be a creative world.

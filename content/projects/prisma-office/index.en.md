# Prisma Office – Corporate – Santa Fe, CDMX – 2026

Comprehensive intervention of finishes for the main entrance and reception of Prisma Office within a corporate floor in Santa Fe. The project starts from a gray work space already defined by the existing envelope, and proposes a contemporary interior identity that combines warmth, geometric precision and industriality, elevating the arrival experience with a sober and technological atmosphere.

The proposal focuses on: control of views from the elevator hallway, clear reading of the access, a leading composition on the back wall and a sculptural ceiling that reinforces the brand character without saturating the space.

## Concept
The conceptual proposal is built with the idea of ​​wave (flow / frequency / movement): a subtle geometry that crosses space and is expressed on three levels:

- Light and rhythm: indirect linear lighting and specific accents to highlight texture and brand.
- Industrial plot: staggered metal grid ceiling that evokes mechanics and precision.
- Organic warmth: wooden lattices and slats with subtle variations that filter light and generate depth.

## Key elements
- Access with 4-leaf gates (2 fixed side + 2 central sliding) and opaque film with graphic design.
- Fixed side lattice with organic pattern that allows light to pass through and generates privacy.
- Mobile lateral lattice (two leaves) that, when closed, is integrated as a single composition; When opened, it enables access to offices.
- Back wall with flexible stone type plates mounted on existing drywall.
- Branded canvas with wooden strips that form a wave, with main letters on the front and directed lighting.
- Prominent ceiling: metal grid panels on frames, organized in “wave” type staggering, framed by a perimeter drywall box.
- Porcelain / wood-type ceramic tile floor (20x90 format or equivalent according to final specification), to balance mineral + wood texture.

## Scope of work
- Conceptual design and development of finishes proposal.
- 3D modeling and coordination of special elements (blacksmithing, carpentry, coatings, metalwork).
- Definition of materials, specifications and installation criteria.
- Delivery of BIMx with views, routes and sheets of the project for approval and execution.

## Suggested materiality
- Wood: natural oak (semi-matte or glossy finish depending on final selection).
- Metal: black/graphite frame (ceiling frames and hidden hardware).
- Flexible stone: mineral texture in gray tones, modular format.
- Glass: window with film (frosted/opaque vinyl) with custom design.
- Floor: porcelain or wood-type ceramic for warmth and resistance.

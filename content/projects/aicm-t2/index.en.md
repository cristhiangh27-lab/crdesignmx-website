# Star Médica Santa Fe · Mexico City · Hospital · 2024

Star Médica Santa Fe is a highly complex hospital project developed in Mexico City, where CR Collective participated in the BIM coordination and technical documentation of facilities, focusing on the integration between design, modeling and on-site execution. The work focused on converting dispersed information and constant changes into an ordered system: reliable 3D models, precise quantification and clear documentation for construction, prioritizing efficient strokes, compatibility with architecture/structure and data-based decision making.

## Architectural concept
The priority of the project was to achieve executable and verifiable installations, not just “pretty in 3D”. We worked with a technical control approach: optimal routes, line hierarchies, interference validation and assembly criteria. The model was used as a coordination tool and as a basis for quantifying, programming and documenting, ensuring coherence between what is designed, what is purchased and what is installed.

## CR Collective Scope
- BIM modeling of facilities (traces, accessories, connections and assembly criteria).
- Design and adjustment of pipe routes and pipelines according to real construction restrictions.
- Interdisciplinary compatibility (detection and correction of interferences).
- Generation and updating of construction plans (floors, isometrics, details and notes).
- Quantification of materials (lengths, diameters, accessories and associated elements).
- Execution support: on-site review, validation of changes and “as-built” documentation when applicable.
- Standardization of deliverables to ensure clear reading by crews and supervision.

## Typical program/deliverables
- Installation plans by level and by system
- Isometrics by critical areas
- Details of crossings, level changes and technical steps
- Quantification tables and lists of materials
- Coordination of adjustments for compatibility and work
- Modification logging and version control

## Additional notes
Project developed in a hospital environment with high demand for precision and coordination. An agile workflow was prioritized, capable of absorbing changes without losing control of the model or quantifications, maintaining consistency between documentation, supply and assembly.

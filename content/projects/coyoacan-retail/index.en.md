# Coyoacán Small Retail Complex - CDMX - Commercial - 2022

Coyoacán Small Retail Complex is a proposed shopping plaza located in Amp. Candelaria, Coyoacán, CDMX. The project is based on the intention of transforming a corner lot into an urban meeting point: a place that, in addition to hosting economic activity, promotes coexistence through a clear organization of routes, wide views and living spaces. The proposal integrates a contemporary front with a nocturnal presence and a recognizable architectural image within the immediate context.

## Architectural concept
The design is built from a central idea: making the structure part of the project language. Instead of being hidden, the structure appears as an expressive element that defines the identity of the complex and organizes the interior spaces. The envelope combines transparencies and filters (lattices/slats) to control light, privacy and temperature, generating a building that is perceived as light, open and dynamic.

The heart of the project is a circulation and living space with natural lighting, designed as a small commercial “atrium” that articulates the premises, generates clear orientations and allows the visitor to walk, look and stay. The roof and structural elements of organic geometry provide character and a contemporary reading, with a nod to parametric solutions and architecture as a spatial experience.

## Architectural program
- Main pedestrian access from corner (urban plaza/anteroom)
- Commercial corridor / main circulation with double height and overhead light
- Commercial premises (oriented towards cafeteria/groceries/neighborhood services)
- Living area / terrace for consumption (tables and coexistence)
- Visual connections between levels (railings and interior voids)
- Sanitary and services for operation of the complex
- Loading/unloading area and technical rooms (depending on operation)
- Parking (perimeter or front, with access control)
- Signage and night image (signboard / architectural lighting)

## Additional notes
The project proposes a commercial solution of a contained scale, but with a strong identity: exposed metal structure, large openings, transparencies and an envelope that works as a climatic and visual filter. The user experience (routes, light, orientation) and constructive feasibility are privileged through a clear and repeatable structural system.

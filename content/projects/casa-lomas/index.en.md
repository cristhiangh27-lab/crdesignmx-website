# Casa Lomas · Veracruz · Residential · 2024

Casa Lomas is a residential project located in Veracruz, Mexico, designed for a family that was looking for a contemporary, functional space with architectural identity. The project is based on giving prominence to social spaces—particularly the kitchen and dining room—integrating them with the exterior through controlled openings, clean geometries and a clear volumetric reading.

## Architectural concept
The design is based on the intention of generating double heights, an orderly vertical circulation and an envelope with a balance between natural light, privacy and contemporary architectural expression. The geometries are defined with clean planes and contrasts between solids and openings, prioritizing sober materiality and durability in hot climates.

## Architectural program
- Main access
- Double height room
- Main kitchen with central bar
- Integrated dining room
- family bedrooms
- Roof garden
- Service area

## Additional notes
This project is part of CR Collective's professional portfolio, modeled in BIM and with detailed architectural representation, favoring clear and viable processes for the client.

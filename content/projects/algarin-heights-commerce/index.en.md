# Algarín Heights & Commerce — CDMX | Mixed use | 2024

Algarín Heights & Commerce is a mixed-use project located in Colonia Algarín, Mexico City, conceived as a complex that integrates residential apartments, a commercial passage and a parking basement, with the objective of activating urban life at street level and optimizing the relationship between housing and commerce.

The approach starts from an open and active ground floor, where commercial premises and anchor businesses are incorporated with fronts towards their respective streets, strengthening security, permanence and pedestrian flow in the immediate environment.

## Collaboration
Project developed in collaboration with:
- Architect Guillermo Olvera Jiménez
- Architect David Alexis Flores Ventura
- Architect Andre Eduardo Miranda Nava

## Project sheet
- Location: Colonia Algarín, CDMX
- Typology: Mixed use (housing + commerce)
- Program: Apartments + commercial passage + premises on the ground floor + parking basement
- Urban strategy: Activation of sidewalk and pedestrian connection through passage
- Focus: Integration of flows, clarity of circulations and contemporary facades

## Urban-architectural concept
The project is organized as a passage that articulates the complex and functions as a “backbone” of the commerce, connecting the accesses from the street and distributing the premises. On this basis, the home is presented as an efficient volume, with clear circulations and an access system that adequately separates the public (commerce) from the private (apartments).

The proposal seeks to balance:
- Urban activity (commercial fronts and anchors towards the street)
- Habitability (privacy, lighting and ventilation)
- Operation (basement parking and organized services)

## Organization of the set
- Basement: Parking and technical/service areas (according to operation criteria of the complex)
- Ground floor: Commercial passage + premises + anchor shops oriented to its streets
- Upper levels: Housing apartments with controlled circulation
- Roof (if applicable): Services and/or amenities (according to the development of the final scheme)

## Key elements
- Commercial passage as an organizer of flows and urban activator
- Premises with clear fronts, facade rhythm and points of attraction (anchors)
- Functional separation between commercial accesses and residential access
- Contemporary façade reading with opening control and access hierarchy
- Prioritization of pedestrian routes and clarity of orientation

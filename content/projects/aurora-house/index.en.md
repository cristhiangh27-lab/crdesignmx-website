# Aurora House · Querétaro · Residential · 2024

Aurora House is a contemporary home designed to maximize the use of a land with real conditions. Due to the presence of party walls that limit the opening of openings on the ground floor, the project shifts the focus to the second level, integrating light and ventilation more efficiently and improving interior comfort.

The proposal seeks a clear connection between interior and exterior through patios and controlled openings, generating bright and habitable spaces. On the roof, the roof garden transforms the roof into a space for recreation and relaxation, designed as a functional extension of the house.

The construction system with steel loss allows a resistant and light structure, favoring viable solutions prepared for future adaptations.

## Architectural concept
The design responds to façade and boundary restrictions through an elevation strategy: reducing front lighting dependencies on the ground floor and taking advantage of the second level to capture natural lighting, ventilation and privacy. The volumetry remains sober and contemporary, prioritizing spatial clarity, functionality and an interior-exterior relationship based on patios and simple routes.

## Architectural program
- Main access
- Social area (living room/stay)
- Integrated kitchen and dining room
- Patio(s) as a source of lighting and ventilation
- Bedroom(s) and services on upper levels
- Roof garden
- Service/storage area (according to customer requirements)

## Additional notes
Residential project developed by CR Collective with a focus on real solutions: responding to the limitations of the site, optimizing the budget and generating contemporary spaces with potential for future growth and adaptation.

# North Finger – AICM Terminal 2 · Interior Remodeling · 2024

## Overview
Conceptual project developed in collaboration with architect Guillermo Olvera Jiménez to renew the interior image of the North Finger and the main ambulatory of Terminal 2 of the Mexico City International Airport. Airport guidelines, passenger flow, lighting, signage and a new spatial reading were considered according to the context of the 2026 World Cup.

## Concept
The proposal proposes an aesthetic and functional update through:
- New materials
- Improvement of general and indirect lighting
- Clearer visual axes
- Integration of patterns and geometries to give identity to the space
- Perceptual reorganization without affecting airport operation

## Key elements
- Conceptual interior design
- Textures, finishes and suggested materiality
- 3D modeling and representation for presentation to client
- Integration with airport criteria

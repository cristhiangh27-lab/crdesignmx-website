# Casa Carmona · Cuautla, Morelos · Rest house · 2024

## Overview
Casa Carmona is a comprehensive rest home project developed for Engineer Ricardo Carmona on land divided into functional polygons. The design focused on the client's specific needs: a kitchen that featured his taste for gastronomy, large and ventilated areas, integration of available recycled tempered glass, and the possibility of future growth.

The project was developed through a complete site survey, 3D BIM modeling and architectural coordination. It is part of CR Collective's recent projects, combining architectural design, technical documentation and interior design proposals.

## Customer requirements
- Large kitchen as a central space
- Four rooms for grandchildren in the red polygon
- Small ecumenical chapel on the green polygon
- Parking and service area in the same green polygon
- Integration of 24 recycled tempered glass panels in the façade and natural lighting
- Preference for contemporary style (not rustic)
- Consider logistical difficulties in transporting steel or sheet metal

## Architectural concept
The project is conceived as a complex articulated by patios and routes. The main house dialogues with the independent volumes of the rooms, generating a relationship between privacy, visual connection and shadow. The kitchen is the heart of the project, designed as a warm and functional space with a main pantry.

The use of recycled tempered glass allows the creation of plays of light and textures, strategically integrating it into the contemporary composition preferred by the client.

## Key elements
- Lambrines in social areas
- Drywall boxes with indirect light
- Kitchen and bar design (designed by Architect Brenda González Aguilar)
- Linear diffusers integrated into the soffit of the fan coil system
- Complete BIM modeling in ArchiCAD

## Project areas
- Main house
- Red polygon: independent rooms for grandchildren
- Green polygon: chapel, parking and possible utility room
- Exterior areas and circulations
